wr-installer
============

This layer provides a target-based installer for Wind River Linux.  It
requires most of the layers that Wind River Linux provides.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the Wind River Linux version of bitbake, oe-core,
wrlinux layer, wr-base layer and wrlcompat layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.

Building the target installer
-----------------------------
The target installer is enabled by passing
"--enable-target-installer=yes" to configure.  A second option
"--with-installer-target-build=<path>" is used to specify the path to
the build directory that will supply rpms and kernel to be installed on
the target.  If the path is an .ext2, .ext3, or ext4 image file, then
the installer will copy this image to the target after the disk has been
partitioned and formatted.  If a target-build is not specified, the
installer project will be used as the target-build.

For example:
configure --enable-board=common_pc \
          --enable-kernel=standard \
          --enable-rootfs=glibc_small \
          --enable-bootimage=iso \
          --enable-target-installer=yes \
          --with-installer-target-build=/home/user/my_project

make fs

The resulting installer will contain the packages from "my_project", and
the default system configuration will match the settings in "my_project".

Note: the board configuration should be the same in both project.

Note: The installer program is incompatible with selinux and this
combination has been disabled.

The installer script can read answers from /etc/installer.conf to help
speed up the installation process.  To add one to the installer image
requires the user to either copy the file to their project directory and/or
configure their local.conf file.

    cp <path>/installer.conf <installer_build_dir>/bitbake_build/conf/.

    or

    edit <installer_build_dir>/bitbake_build/conf/local.conf
    WRL_INSTALLER_CONF = "/my/installer.conf"
