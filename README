wr-installer
============

This layer provides a target-based installer for Wind River Linux.  It
requires most of the layers that Wind River Linux provides.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the Wind River Linux version of bitbake, oe-core,
wrlinux layer, wr-base layer and wrlcompat layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.

Building the target installer
-----------------------------
The target installer is enabled by passing "--enable-target-installer=yes"
to configure.  A second option "--with-installer-target-build=<path>" is
used to specify the absolute path to the build directory that will supply
rpms and kernel to be installed on the target.  If the absolute path is an
.ext3 image file, then the installer will copy this image to the target
after the disk has been partitioned and formatted.  If a target-build is 
not specified, the installer project will be used as the target-build.

For example:
configure --enable-board=common_pc \
          --enable-kernel=standard \
          --enable-rootfs=glibc_small \
          --enable-bootimage=iso \
          --enable-target-installer=yes \
          --with-installer-target-build=/home/user/my_project

make fs

The resulting installer will contain the packages from "my_project", and
the default system configuration will match the settings in "my_project".

Note: the board configuration should be the same in both project.


Known Issues
------------

*) The 'desired' package list only includes the items that the image
   recipe selected.  Any dependencies to those packages are not lists.

*) When choosing extra image features to install, this adds significant time
   to the install process.

*) Upgrade of an existing image may take a significant amount of time to complete,
   even if no image changes have been selected.
